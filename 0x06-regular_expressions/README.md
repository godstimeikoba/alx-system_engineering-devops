Regular expression

A regular expression (regex) is a text pattern that can be used for searching and replacing. Regular expressions are similar to Unix wild cards used in globbing, but much more powerful, and can be used to search, replace and validate text.

Regular expressions are used in many Unix commands such as find and grep, and also within most programming languages such as R and Python.
